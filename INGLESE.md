## Pre-Romantic poets
### Thomas Gray
* Romantic tone
* preoccupation with death
* love for ruins, graveyards and solitary places
* influenced Ugo Foscolo's *Dei Sepolcri*
  * Foscolo rejects the idea that graves make all men equal
    * graves = memories of great men and monument's to man's power of extending his short living existance
  * Gray tries to reconcile with nature, Foscolo tries to overtake it (man are capable of shaping future generations)

### William Blake (1757-1827)
* born in London, educated at home, became an engraver, got into poetry, never succeeded (in life), died
* dissatisfied with society which **lacks imagination**
* the poet has the power of uncorrupted feeling &#8594; his works are detached from his age

##### Blake's dual vision of life
* infancy and adult life are **complementary opposites**
  * they **coexist** in the human being
* the opposites of life can be represented using twin **symbols**, representing different positions towards existance

#### Songs of Innocence (1789)
* engraved by Blake on copper plates with pictures (**illuminated printing**)
* focused on infancy
  * child-like language
  * childhood as a state of the soul

##### The Lamb
* animal representing the innocence of childhood but also Jesus Christ
```
   For he calls himself a lamb,
   He is meek and he is mild,
   He became a little child
```
* connection between God, the lamb and the poet
```
   I a child and thou a lamb
   We are called by his name
```

#### Songs of Experience (1794)
* shift to the second stage of human life: adult experience
  * world of selfish people **incapable of spontaneity**

##### The Tyger
* paradox of the tiger resembling that of the revolution
  * *fearful symmetry*: beauty and terror deeply connected
  * the tiger is forged by the forces of good and evil together
    * the **French Revolution** is similar: good values that brought violence and terror with them
* the tiger as a product of the **Industrial Revolution**
```
	What the hammer? What the chain? 
	In what furnace was thy brain?
```
* the violence of the tiger (and the revolution) seen as the destructive impulses of child
  * connection with The Lamb (Blake pictures the tiger with the face of a lamb)

### William Wordsworth (1770-1850)
* supporter of the French Revolution at first
* met Coleridge in 1795, by this time he had become disillusioned with the Revolution because of the terror
* worked with Coleridge on *Lyrical Ballads*
  * his object was to give the charm of **novelty to things of every day** (he draws inspiration from everyday life)
    * the poet has the power of imagination and can help ordinary people express their inner selves
    * the best subject is **humble rustic life**
  * Coleridge's objective was more "romantic", aimed to provoke a *suspension of disbelief*
* focus on **nature** and its effect on the human mind
  * nature as the expression of the ideal in the real

#### I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (1815)
* inspired by a walk with his sister Dorothy and the sight of a field of daffodils
* man as a cloud: removed from the ground and floating free
* inversion of perception: field as a *host* of flowers, like an **infinite** sky full of stars
* experience lived unconsciously and then recalled from **memory**

#### Sonnet Composed upon Westminster Bridge (1802)
* set in an urban environment but without the urban aspects to it
  * no effects of the Industrial Revolution (*smokeless air*)
  * opposite to Blake's *London*
  * fusion **man + nature** which can only occur in **solitude**
* set at dawn, when the city is quiet
* nostalgia for the **idyllic natural landscape** that is disappearing

### Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834)
* worked with Wordsworth on the *Lyrical Ballads*, for which he writes *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner*
* like Wordsworth, pro-revolution at first, then conservative

#### The Rime of the Ancient Mariner
* story of a mariner who killed an albatross for no apparent reason and is then punished for that
* written in the form of a **medieval ballad**, meant to be read by anyone
* creation of a magical world where realistic and supernatural coexist
* many possible interpretations
  * parable of the man and the **original sin**
    * the *act* of the mariner is without reason
    * the *punishment* is isolation from the rest of the crew on the ship
    * the *penitence* is the obsessive and unavoidable repetition of the story
  * conflict between man and nature
    * the tendency of man to **overcome nature's limits**
  * the **curse of the poet**, living beyond the limit that ordinary people set
  * opposition **rationality** (the sun) *vs* **irrationality** (the moon, under the light of which the main good events occur)
    * conflict between the real world (where the mariner narrates the story) and the imaginated one

### Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822)
* highly educated
* radical thinker, expelled from University for circulating pamphlets on the necessity of atheism
* peculiar **highly-toned style**
  * the idea he wants to convey is more profound than words
  * words and objects hide a **deeper absolute** which they fail to express
  * **impersonal** poems, often set in **desolate places**

#### Ozymandias (ca. 1817)
* travel to the *antique land* (Egypt) and sight of Ramses II's statue
  * the faraon's body is missing
    * allusion to the body of the empire (the land and the people) that are missing as well
    * opposition of the present and past time and the **almighty destiny**
> Look on my works, ye mighty and despair
  * the works of the emperor are missing, because **time annihilates everything**
> nothing beside remains
  * the *works* could be the ones of distruction carried out by the Emperor
    * allusion to devastation caused by **imperial ambitions**

#### Ode to the West Wind (1819)
* written in the form of an Elizabethan **sonnet** using Dante's *terza rima*
* ode addressed to the wind, seen as a force of destruction and creation at the same time
  * **cyclic vision** of life and death connected to the seasons
    * dead leaves that work airborne seeds for new plants to be born
    * dual nature of the wind similar to Blake's Lamb/Tyger (intrinsically bound opposites)
* wind causing chaos and melting together (breaking limits between) sky, sea and land
