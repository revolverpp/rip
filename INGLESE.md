* the poet has the power of uncorrupted feeling &#8594; his works are detached from his age

##### Blake's dual vision of life
* infancy and adult life are **complementary opposites**
  * they **coexist** in the human being
* the opposites of life can be represented using twin **symbols**, representing different positions towards existance

#### Songs of Innocence (1789)
* engraved by Blake on copper plates with pictures (**illuminated printing**)
* focused on infancy
  * child-like language
  * childhood as a state of the soul

##### The Lamb
* animal representing the innocence of childhood but also Jesus Christ
```For he calls himself a lamb,
   He is meek and he is mild,
   **He became a little child**```
* connection between God, the lamb and the poet
```I a child and thou a lamb
   We are called by his name```

#### Songs of Experience (1794)
* shift to the second stage of human life: adult experience
  * world of selfish people **incapable of spontaneity**

##### The Tyger
* paradox of the tiger resembling that of the revolution
  * *fearful symmetry*: beauty and terror deeply connected
  * the tiger is forged by the forces of good and evil together
    * the **French Revolution** is similar: good values that brought violence and terror with them
* the tiger as a product of the **Industrial Revolution**
```
	What the hammer? What the chain? 
	In what furnace was thy brain?
```
* the violence of the tiger (and the revolution) seen as the destructive impulses of child
